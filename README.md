# Claire

**Turn a one-line idea into shipped code — with AI doing the clarifying, speccing, planning, reviewing, and you doing the approving.**

Claire is an AI-assisted product delivery platform. You describe a feature in plain language; Claire clarifies the ambiguities, writes the PRD, breaks it into tasks, opens the work on GitHub, reviews the resulting pull request, and walks it through an approval gate to "shipped" — all on one visible pipeline.

> **Core loop:** idea → AI clarifies → PRD → tasks → code → AI review → approve → **ship** 🚢

## 🔁 The pipeline (the heart of Claire)

Every feature request moves through a single status enum (`feature_status`) that drives the board columns and the AI workflow:

```
received → analyzing → (clarification_needed ↔ accepted)
  → prd_generating → prd_ready → tasks_generating → tasks_ready
  → in_development → in_review → (fix_needed ↻)
  → ready_for_approval → shipped
```

**Terminal / branch states:** `duplicate`, `feature_exists`, `bug_report`, `out_of_scope`, `rejected`, `failed`.

**Full enum values** (from `packages/db/src/schema.ts`, exact casing):

```
received | analyzing | clarification_needed | accepted | duplicate |
feature_exists | bug_report | out_of_scope | prd_generating | prd_ready |
tasks_generating | tasks_ready | in_development | in_review | fix_needed |
ready_for_approval | shipped | rejected | failed
```

**Dashboard board columns map to status buckets:**

| Column | Statuses |
|---|---|
| Discovery | `received`, `analyzing`, `clarification_needed`, `accepted`, `duplicate`, `feature_exists`, `bug_report`, `out_of_scope`, `failed` |
| Planning | `prd_generating`, `prd_ready`, `tasks_generating`, `tasks_ready` |
| Building | `in_development`, `fix_needed` |
| Reviewing | `in_review` |
| Approval | `ready_for_approval`, `rejected` |
| Shipped | `shipped` |

## 🗄️ Database schema notes

Key tables (see `packages/db/src/schema.ts`):

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `user`, `account`, `session` | BetterAuth identity (email/password + GitHub) |
| `organization`, `member` | Workspaces and membership/roles |
| `workspace_settings` | Per-org plan + limits (`plan`, `aiCreditsLimit`, `aiCreditsUsed`, `repoLimit`, `memberLimit`, `githubInstallationId`) |
| `invite_links` | Tokenized join links (`token`, `organizationId`, `expiresAt`) — reusable 7-day tokens consumed by `/join/[token]` |
| `feature_requests` | Feature requests + their `feature_status` (drives the pipeline) |
| `workflow_steps` | Polymorphic progress log (`entityType`, `entityId`, `step`, `status`) — written by Inngest functions to record each pipeline step. **Note:** uses a polymorphic `(entityType, entityId: text)` pattern with no typed FK; query directly with `eq(workflowSteps.entityId, String(id))` — do **not** join via Drizzle `with: { workflowSteps }` (will 500). |
| `clarification_threads` | Clarification questions and user answers (`question`, `questionType`, `options`, `answer`) linked to feature requests |
| `prds` | Product requirements documents (1:1 with feature) |
| `tasks` | Engineering tasks broken down from a PRD |
| `repositories` | Connected GitHub repos + installation tracking |
| `pull_requests` | Tracked PRs linked to features |
| `pull_request_files` | Per-file diff data for PR reviews |
| `ai_reviews` | AI code review results + pass/fail status |
| `review_issues` | Individual issues from reviews (BLOCKING / NON_BLOCKING / SUGGESTION) |
| `approvals` | Admin approval decisions on features (`decision`, `notes`, `reviewerId`) |
| `payments` | Razorpay orders/upgrades (idempotent FREE→PRO) |
| `billing_orders` | Order tracking for billing |
| `webhook_logs` | Stored GitHub webhook deliveries (enables offline replay in the demo) |

**Plans & AI Credits:** FREE = 500 AI credits / 3 repos / 10 members · PRO = 5 000 / 25 / 50. AI credits are enforced atomically per operation via conditional SQL updates (`triage: 1`, `taskGeneration: 2`, `prdGeneration: 3`, `review: 5`, `reReview: 5`).

## 🐙 GitHub integration

Claire uses **two** GitHub apps:
- an **OAuth App** for user login (`/api/auth/callback/github`), and
- a **GitHub App** for repository access (code, PRs, webhooks).

**GitHub App setup**
1. Create a GitHub App (Settings → Developers → GitHub Apps).
2. **Permissions required** (derived from the Octokit calls in `packages/github/src/index.ts`):

   | Scope | Level | Used by |
   |---|---|---|
   | **Pull requests** | Read & Write | `pulls.get`, `pulls.listFiles`, `pulls.createReview` |
   | **Issues** | Read & Write | `issues.createComment` (fallback review posting) |
   | **Metadata** | Read-only | `apps.listReposAccessibleToInstallation` |

3. **Webhook URL:** `https://<your-domain>/api/webhooks/github`
4. **Webhook secret:** set it and store as `GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
5. **Subscribe to events:** `pull_request`, `installation`, `installation_repositories`.
6. Generate a **private key** → `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`.
7. **Install** the App on the repos you want Claire to manage.

**Webhook replay (demo):** every delivery is persisted in `webhook_logs`, so the "Replay Webhook" action can re-run a stored delivery offline — handy for demoing the review flow without a live PR.

## ⚙️ Inngest workflows

Each AI step runs as an Inngest function so long-running work happens off the request path. All functions live in `packages/jobs/src/functions/`.

| Function ID | Event(s) | File | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `feature-intake` | `feature/intake` | `intake.ts` | Triages a new feature request with strict timeouts (`1x20s` model attempt, `55s` function finish). **Steps:** `analyze` → check for single-word/vague requests (enforcing mandatory multiple-choice clarification) → scan existing workspace backlog for exact semantic matches (`duplicate` / `feature_exists`) → classify → atomically deduct AI credits (`consume-triage`) → if proceed: generate PRD → set `prd_ready`. |
| `feature-clarification-answered` | `feature/clarification.answered` | `clarification.ts` | Re-evaluates after a user answers a clarification question. **Steps:** `re-analyze` → re-classify with answer context against existing backlog → deduct AI credits → if proceed: generate PRD → set `prd_ready`. |
| `prd-approved` | `prd/approved` | `prd.ts` | Generates engineering tasks from an approved PRD. **Steps:** `tasks` → deduct AI credits → AI breaks PRD into typed/prioritized tasks → insert task rows → set `tasks_ready`. |
| `github-pr-review` | `github/pr.opened`, `github/pr.synchronize` | `review.ts` | Full AI code review of a pull request. **Steps:** `fetching_context` → load PR + feature + PRD + previous reviews → `fetching_diff` → fetch + budget diff files (≤40 files, ≤80k tokens) → deduct AI credits → `create_review_row` → `analyzing_code` → AI generates issues → `save_and_diff` → persist + diff resolved issues → `update_feature` → set `fix_needed` or `ready_for_approval` → `posting_github` → post inline review (fallback: plain comment). |
| `feature-shipped` | `feature/shipped` | `ship.ts` | Records the ship event. **Steps:** compute `timeToShipDays` → set `shipped` → write workflow step. |

Additionally, a `noop` function (`noop/run`) exists in `packages/jobs/src/index.ts` for Inngest dev-server connectivity testing.

## 🤖 AI features

All model calls go through OpenRouter. Model selection is cost-aware, tiered, and routed via a shared `generateObjectResilient` helper (Zod validation + graceful failure).

| Tier | Model | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| **light** | `google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite` | Quick / lightweight background tasks |
| **default** | `google/gemini-2.5-flash` | General AI workflows + fallback |
| **review** | `z-ai/glm-5.2` | Standard PR / code review |
| **premiumReview** | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6` | Premium code review |

> **Note:** PR/code review uses GLM-5.2 (standard) and Claude Sonnet 4.6 (premium review), while routine generation (clarification, PRD, tasks) uses the Gemini 2.5 Flash tier.

Implemented capabilities:

- **Triage & duplicate detection** — upgraded to `google/gemini-2.5-flash` (`default` tier) with strict 20s timeouts (`1x20s`) and function finish backstops (`55s`). Scans recent workspace features to surface duplicates (`duplicate`), existing features (`feature_exists`), out-of-scope, and bug reports before any work begins.
- **Mandatory clarification (vagueness-first prompt)** — enforces a strict vagueness check on single-word or underspecified requests before evaluating classification, generating structured multiple-choice (`CHOICE`) or text clarification questions.
- **Atomic AI credit enforcement** — per-operation credit schedule (`triage: 1`, `taskGeneration: 2`, `prdGeneration: 3`, `review: 5`, `reReview: 5`) with atomic conditional SQL updates preventing race conditions or negative credit balances. When exhausted, records `CREDITS_EXHAUSTED:` sentinel to prompt an upgrade CTA in the UI.
- **PRD generation** — structured product spec (problem, goals, non-goals, user stories, acceptance criteria, edge cases, success metrics).
- **Task generation** — PRD → discrete, typed (`FEATURE` / `BUG` / `CHORE` / `TEST` / `DOCS`), prioritized, independently shippable tasks with suggested branch names.
- **AI code review** — reviews the PR diff against the linked PRD; flags issues with severity (`BLOCKING` / `NON_BLOCKING` / `SUGGESTION`) and type (requirement mismatch, security, performance, missing tests, etc.). Posts inline GitHub review comments with fallback to plain comment.
- **Re-review & issue diffing** — on subsequent pushes, resolved issues from the previous review are fingerprinted and marked resolved automatically.

## 💳 Billing (Razorpay, test mode)

One-time **Upgrade to Pro** flow: server-created order → Razorpay Standard Checkout → server-side signature verification → idempotent FREE→PRO upgrade in `workspace_settings`.

**Testing:** International cards are disabled on a default Indian Razorpay account, so use **Netbanking** or **UPI `success@razorpay`** in test mode. Test card (if enabled): `4111 1111 1111 1111`, any future expiry, any CVV.

## 🔒 Security & Multi-Tenant Isolation

Claire enforces strict multi-tenant data boundaries and securely quarantines the shared demo experience:
- **Global Data Isolation:** All API queries and mutations strictly filter by `ctx.orgId` derived from the server session. Cross-tenant reads/writes are impossible.
- **Webhook Authenticity & Isolation:** GitHub incoming webhooks are strictly guarded by `verifyWebhookSignature` using HMAC SHA-256. All webhook-driven database updates (like repository renames or PR syncs) are strictly scoped by `installationId` and `organizationId` to prevent cross-tenant data corruption.
- **Systemic Demo Quarantine:** The demo user (`demo@claire.app`) is strictly hardcoded to the demo organization (`DEMO_ORG_ID`). A global tRPC middleware (`protectedOrgProcedure`) guarantees that the demo user gets `FORBIDDEN` if they attempt to interact with any other workspace.
- **Secure Invites:** Workspace invite links are protected against stale-session attacks. `joinAction` server actions validate the invite token and extract the `organizationId` natively from the server database, never trusting the client closure.
- **IDOR Prevention:** Public endpoints (like portal polling) use cryptographically secure `trackingToken`s instead of sequential IDs. Authenticated endpoints rigorously verify ownership (e.g., `feature.updateStatus` and `workflow.getSteps` enforce admin/owner roles and workspace matching).
- **Payment Verification:** Razorpay checkout completions are verified server-side. The API fetches the true payment status directly from the Razorpay backend (`rzp.payments.fetch`) before upgrading a workspace, preventing client-side spoofing.
- **CSRF Protection:** State-mutating actions (such as demo-logout) are correctly implemented as `POST` endpoints to prevent `<Link>` prefetch side-effects or crawler-induced logouts.

---

## 🛡️ Robustness & Atomicity

- **Atomic AI Credits:** AI credits are enforced atomically per operation via conditional SQL updates (`triage: 1`, `taskGeneration: 2`, `prdGeneration: 3`, `review: 5`).
- **Consume-Before-Save:** To prevent AI credit leaks during retries, Inngest workflows consume credits inside idempotent `step.run` blocks *before* persisting the generated results to the database.
- **Idempotency & Duplicate Guards:** Workflows use Inngest's `step.run` memoization to guarantee exactly-once execution. Data ingestion from GitHub (like syncing PRs and repositories) uses partial unique indexes and `onConflictDoUpdate` to seamlessly handle duplicate webhook deliveries without crashing or creating orphan data.
- **Strict Type Safety:** Zod is used for all runtime boundary parsing (e.g., Inngest event payloads, tRPC inputs). The codebase adheres to strict TypeScript compiler checks without relying on unsafe `any` casts.
